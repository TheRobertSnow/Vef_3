Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a 
programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using 
object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, 
a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
In object-oriented programming, data-management tasks act on object-oriented (OO) 
objects that are almost always non-scalar values.
